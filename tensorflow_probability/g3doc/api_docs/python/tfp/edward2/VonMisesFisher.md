# tfp.edward2.VonMisesFisher

Create a random variable for VonMisesFisher.

``` python
tfp.edward2.VonMisesFisher(
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```



Defined in [`python/edward2/interceptor.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/tree/master/tensorflow_probability/python/edward2/interceptor.py).

#### Returns:
RandomVariable.


#### Original Docstring for Distribution

Creates a new `VonMisesFisher` instance.

#### Args:

* <b>`mean_direction`</b>: Floating-point `Tensor` with shape [B1, ... Bn, D].
  A unit vector indicating the mode of the distribution, or the
  unit-normalized direction of the mean. (This is *not* in general the
  mean of the distribution; the mean is not generally in the support of
  the distribution.) NOTE: `D` is currently restricted to <= 5.
* <b>`concentration`</b>: Floating-point `Tensor` having batch shape [B1, ... Bn]
  broadcastable with `mean_direction`. The level of concentration of
  samples around the `mean_direction`. `concentration=0` indicates a
  uniform distribution over the unit hypersphere, and `concentration=+inf`
  indicates a `Deterministic` distribution (delta function) at
  `mean_direction`.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
  parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
  performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
  outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
  statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
  indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
  if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: For known-bad arguments, i.e. unsupported event dimension.
